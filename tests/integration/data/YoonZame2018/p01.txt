Abstract—Missing data is a ubiquitous problem. It is
especially challenging in medical settings because many
streams of measurements are collected at different—and
often irregular—times. Accurate estimation of the missing
measurements is critical for many reasons, including di-
agnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Existing methods ad-
dress this estimation problem by interpolating within data
streams or imputing across data streams (both of which
ignore important information) or ignoring the temporal as-
pect of the data and imposing strong assumptions about
the nature of the data-generating process and/or the pat-
tern of missing data (both of which are especially prob-
lematic for medical data). We propose a new approach,
based on a novel deep learning architecture that we call
a Multi-directional Recurrent Neural Network that interpo-
lates within data streams and imputes across data streams.
We demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to
ﬁve real-world medical datasets. We show that it provides
dramatically improved estimation of missing measurements
in comparison to 11 state-of-the-art benchmarks (including
Spline and Cubic Interpolations, MICE, MissForest, matrix
completion, and several RNN methods); typical improve-
ments in Root Mean Squared Error are between 35%–50%.
Additional experiments based on the same ﬁve datasets
demonstrate that the improvements provided by our method
are extremely robust.

settings which present time series containing many streams of
measurements that are sampled at different and irregular times,
and is especially important in these settings because accurate

estimation of these missing measurements is often critical for
accurate diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, as well as for ac-
curate modeling and statistical analyses. This paper presents a
new method for estimating missing measurements in time series
data, based on a novel deep learning architecture. By compar-
ing our method with current state-of-the-art benchmarks on a
variety of real-world medical datasets, we demonstrate that our
method is much more accurate in estimating missing measure-
ments, and that this accuracy is reﬂected in improved prediction
of outcomes.
The most familiar methods for estimating missing data fol-
low one of three approaches, usually called interpolation, im-
putation and matrix completion. Interpolation methods such as
[1], [2] exploit the correlation among measurements at differ-
ent times within each stream but ignore the correlation across
streams. Imputation methods such as [3]–[6] exploit the corre-
lation among measurements at the same time across different
streams but ignore the correlation within streams. Because med-
ical measurements are frequently correlated both within streams
and across streams (e.g., blood pressure at a given time is cor-
related both with blood pressure at other times and with heart
rate), each of these approaches loses potentially important infor-
mation. Matrix completion methods such as [7]–[10] do exploit
correlations within and across streams, but assume that the data
is static – hence ignore the temporal component of the data –
or that the data is perfectly synchronized – an assumption that
is routinely violated in medical time series data. Some of these
methods also make modeling assumptions about the nature of
the data-generating process or of the pattern of missing data. Our
approach is expressly designed to exploit both the correlation
within streams and the correlation across streams and to take
into account the temporal and non-synchronous character of the
data; our approach makes no modeling assumptions about the
data-generating process or the pattern of missing data. (We do
assume – as is standard in most of the literature – that the data is
missing at random [1]. Dealing with data that is not missing at
random [11] presents additional challenges and is left for future
works.)
Our method relies on a novel neural network architecture that
we call a Multi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (M-RNN).
Our M-RNN contains both an interpolation block and an im-
putation block and it trains these blocks simultaneously, rather
than separately (See Fig. 1 and 2). Like a bi-directional RNN
(Bi-RNN) [12], an M-RNN operates forward and backward

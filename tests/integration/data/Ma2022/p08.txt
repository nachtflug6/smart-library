contrary results for the 𝜇𝑖case do not necessarily mean that
the frequency components in the cosine term is lack of time-
dependency, it could be that well capturing the time-varying
pattern of the periodical correlation of the signal is relatively
difficult during training. The improvement of representation
capability of our proposed NsTKA method might be accom-
panied with certain decrease in robustness when dealing
with certain datasets, which could be improved with more
careful hyperparameter selection or more available data sam-
ples. To further improve the robustness and performance of
the model is also a future topic of our research.

Case Study (Q3)
To study how the proposed method performs on different scenarios,
we create synthetic datasets with different levels of non-stationarity.
Specifically, the coefficients 𝛼𝑖, 𝛽𝑖in Eq.14 and Eq.15 are chang-
ing with different speed with respect to time. Namely, two speed-
coefficients 𝑐𝛼𝑖,𝑐𝛽𝑖are further introduced. As a result, the new
amplitude and frequency functions are 𝐴𝑖(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑖,0(1 + 𝑐𝛼𝑖𝛼𝑖𝑡/𝑇)
and 𝜔𝑖(𝑡) = 𝜔𝑖,0 ∗𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑐𝛽𝑖𝛽𝑖𝑡/𝑇), respectively. One thing to note is
that, when the coefficients change in a negligible magnitude (i.e.,
𝑐𝛼𝑖= 0,𝑐𝛽𝑖= 0), the synthetic signal is actually stationary. Intu-
itively, Figure 4 illustrated as an example of signals with different
values of 𝑐𝛼𝑖,𝑐𝛽𝑖. Compared with the stationary signal, the ampli-
tude and frequency of other two ones change over time to different
degrees.

Table 5: Mean squared error of methods Transformer+NsTKA
and Transformer+ME when fitting the signals with different
non-stationary levels.
While keeping all the other parameters in Eq. 13 the same, Table
5 presents the relative gain between NsTKA and ME under the
different values of 𝑐𝛼𝑖,𝑐𝛽𝑖. We can observe that:
• For a stationary dataset, NsTKA shows a similar performance
with the related method, ME, which is derived from a station-
ary kernel. It suggests that NsTKA can also fit the dataset
well on a degenerated setting, even though the kernel is
non-stationary.
• For non-stationary datasets, as the increasing level of non-
stationarity, NsTKA shows a more and more significant

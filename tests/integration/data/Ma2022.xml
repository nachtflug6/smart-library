Though prevalent and effective in many applications, conventional approaches such as RNNs and Transformers, struggle with handling the non-stationary characteristics (i.e., such temporal-correlation among events would change over time), which is indeed encountered in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a non-stationary time-aware kernelized attention approach for input sequences of neural networks. By constructing the Generalized Spectral Mixture Kernel (GSMK), and integrating it to the attention mechanism, we mathematically reveal its representation capability in terms of the time-dependent temporal-correlation. Following that, a novel neural network structure is proposed, which would enable us to encode both stationary and non-stationary time event series. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on both synthetic data which presents the theoretical insights, and a variety of real-world datasets which shows its competitive performance against related work.</p>

And in most real-world scenarios, such relations not only depend on the characteristics of the event itself but also the ordering of temporal or spatial information at which the events occur.

Furthermore, using the mathematical relationship between kernel and attention, in this paper, we organically couple the proposed nonstationary temporal encoding kernel with the original attention mechanism.

These related methods cannot encode a non-stationary signal well. Specifically, by seeing Eq.3, the amplitude (i.e., 1) and frequencies (i.e., 1 10000 2𝑖/𝑑 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 ) are predefined and then kept constant during the learning process, which limits its representation capability. Furthermore, since it takes the discrete positional index as input, it cannot encode irregular continuous time-interval information into the representation. In Eq.5, although the amplitude (i.e., √︁ 𝑐 * (𝜔 * )) and frequencies (i.e., 𝑗𝜋 𝜔 * ) are learnable, they are independent with the absolute time 𝑡. As mentioned above, the Mercer's time embedding is essentially a dual representation of a temporal translation-invariant kernel. Taking the Mercer's embedding into the context of expressing temporal correlations between events &lt; Φ 𝑀 𝑑 (𝑡 𝑖 ), Φ 𝑀 𝑑 (𝑡 𝑗 ) &gt;, the correlation would naturally be temporal translation-invariant thus limiting its capability of encoding non-stationary signals.</p>

Although the aforementioned work has discussed the kernel view of expressing attention weights in a temporal and non-temporal correlation way, there is limited discussion in diving into the design choice of kernels. In the next section, by comparison, we present the competitive performance of our method.

We can see that, compared with RNN-like methods, Transformer variations show a significant improvement. Through introducing PE for explicitly modeling position information, we observed a further improvement. This demonstrates that temporal correlation among events is critical in forecasting the following event. Replacing PE with ME, the continuous time-span information is taken into consideration so that the fine-grained temporal patterns can be captured. The proposed method, Transformer+NsTKA, outperforms competitors by a large margin on both the synthetic datasets and real-world datasets in most cases. Specifically, on different types of non-stationary datasets and a number of temporal datasets on different domains, Transformer+NsTKA consistently shows the best or the secondbest performance, which indicates that the proposed method can capture non-stationary patterns under complex settings. Furthermore, on two of the synthetic datasets, Transformer + PE has a better performance than ours. It might due to the reason that the classic PE takes the format of predefined sine and cosine functions and our synthetic dataset is also composed of sinusoidal waves. With proper initialization, the Transformer + PE method can capture the dominating temporal patterns well. Nevertheless, in terms of the representation capability in a much wider range, the above results have well verified the necessity of encoding non-stationary characteristics.

It is readily observed that the proposed method can precisely fit the curve the best. Since these baseline methods are designed for stationary datasets, the models would try to fit the targeted curve with a stationary basis, resulting in a misalignment both on the frequency and amplitude. Specifically, we can see that curves fitted by these baseline methods cannot align well within valleys and peaks because valleys and peaks do not occur in a fixed period. A similar phenomenon can also be observed on the fitting of the amplitudes. This further demonstrates that the model capacity of these baseline methods is not good enough to fit the non-stationary pattern.

To show the effectiveness of encoding non-stationarity through our proposed method, we firstly modify NsTKA by replacing the non-stationary kernel with a stationary kernel, while other components keep unchanged. Furthermore, the GSM kernel can also be considered as the product of three kernels, i.e., the linear kernel 𝛼 𝑖 (𝑥)𝛼 𝑖 (𝑥 ′ ), the Gibbs kernel, and the cosine kernel, which are all dependent on the absolute time. By reducing each component into an 𝑥-independent term or completely removing the component, we analyze how each component contributes to the improvement. 5.5.1 Effectiveness of Non-stationary Kernel.

On one hand, it suggests that 𝑥 is of great importance on both the 𝑙 𝑖 (𝑥) and 𝛼 𝑖 (𝑥) parts of the kernel, which represents the short-and long-range temporal dependency and component weights separately as described in section 4.

It suggests that NsTKA can also fit the dataset well on a degenerated setting, even though the kernel is non-stationary. • For non-stationary datasets, as the increasing level of nonstationarity, NsTKA shows a more and more significant improvement comparing with the baseline on both decaying scenarios, which demonstrates the powerful ability of NsTKA to delineate the non-stationary temporal patterns.</p>

Then, a new attention structure is devised for input sequences of neural networks. Finally, exhaustive experiments are conducted to present its competitive performance against related work, followed by an ablation experiment which shows its effectiveness on both stationary and non-stationary temporal correlations. We would further improve the robustness and performance of the method in our future work. Furthermore, we plan to extend our method to the reinforcement learning domain, as the ability to predict future off-policy performance in non-stationary environments is common and critical in real-world scenarios.</p>

                    <p>contrary results for the 𝜇 𝑖 case do not necessarily mean that the frequency components in the cosine term is lack of timedependency, it could be that well capturing the time-varying pattern of the periodical correlation of the signal is relatively difficult during training. The improvement of representation capability of our proposed NsTKA method might be accompanied with certain decrease in robustness when dealing with certain datasets, which could be improved with more careful hyperparameter selection or more available data samples. To further improve the robustness and performance of the model is also a future topic of our research.</p>

                <figDesc>Results on the dataset SynD with different combinations of kernels.To study how the proposed method performs on different scenarios, we create synthetic datasets with different levels of non-stationarity. Specifically, the coefficients 𝛼 𝑖 , 𝛽 𝑖 in Eq.14 and Eq.15 are changing with different speed with respect to time. Namely, two speedcoefficients 𝑐 𝛼 𝑖 , 𝑐 𝛽 𝑖 are further introduced. As a result, the new amplitude and frequency functions are 𝐴 𝑖 (𝑡) = 𝐴 𝑖,0 (1 + 𝑐 𝛼 𝑖 𝛼 𝑖 𝑡/𝑇 ) and 𝜔 𝑖 (𝑡) = 𝜔 𝑖,0 * 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (𝑐 𝛽 𝑖 𝛽 𝑖 𝑡/𝑇 ), respectively. One thing to note is that, when the coefficients change in a negligible magnitude (i.e., 𝑐 𝛼 𝑖 = 0, 𝑐 𝛽 𝑖 = 0), the synthetic signal is actually stationary. Intuitively, Figure4illustrated as an example of signals with different values of 𝑐 𝛼 𝑖 , 𝑐 𝛽 𝑖 . Compared with the stationary signal, the amplitude and frequency of other two ones change over time to different degrees.Figure 4: An example of signals with different values of 𝑐 𝛼 𝑖 , 𝑐 𝛽 𝑖 . 𝑐 𝛼 𝑖 𝑐 𝛽 𝑖</figDesc>

Interpretable embedding. To utilize information from
both views, we combine them via an embedding layer. We
select rectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU) as the activation function
because it enables the learned representations to be inter-
pretable. The expression is given below:
xadjust
t
= ReLU(Wemb[xu
t ; xs
t] + bemb)
(15)
The adjusted previous hidden status as given in Eq. (6)
and the adjusted input as given in Eq. (15) are then injected
into a standard GRU:
zt = δ(Wzxadjust
t
+ Uzhd
t−1 + bz)
(16)
rt = δ(Wrxadjust
t
+ Urhd
t−1 + br)
(17)
˜ht = tanh(Wxadjust
t
+ U(rt ⊙hd
t−1) + b)
(18)
ht = (1 −zt) ⊙hd
t−1 + zt⊙˜ht
(19)
where δ(•) is sigmoid function; Wz, Uz, Wr, Ur, W and U
are trainable matrices; bz, br and b are trainable vectors.
Objective Function. We use a softmax layer to generate
the mortality risk scores from the hidden status at the last
timestamp of the observation window:
˜yt = softmax(Wpredht + bpred)
(20)
where Wpred and bpred are trainable matrix and vector.
We use cross-entropy as the objective function to calcu-
late the classiﬁcation loss between the true mortality label ˜y
and the predicted label ˜yt for each patient:
Loss(˜y, ˜yt) = 1
Tk
Tk

t=1
(˜y log ˜yt + (1 −˜y) log(1 −˜yt))
(21)
During the training process, the losses for all the patients in
each minibatch are summed up to obtain the total loss for
back propagation.
Experiments
Data Description and Experimental Settings
We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, i.e.,
MIMIC-III (Johnson et al. 2016) and eICU Collaborative
Research Dataset (Pollard et al. 2018).
MIMIC-III consists of medical records of 58K patients
collected at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center over 11
years. We use the 20 most frequent laboratory parameters
and the 30 most frequent chartevents as inputs. We set the
observation window as 5 days and utilize all the patients
meeting the following three conditions: 1) adult (aged 18
years or above); 2) at least one of the 20 laboratory parame-
ters is not empty; 3) at least one of the 30 chartevents is not
empty. We ﬁnally get a cohort of 34,660 patients. We con-
duct two kinds of prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality risk
prediction (predict the likelihood of death for a patient dur-
ing the treatment in hospital) and short-term mortality risk
prediction (predict the likelihood of death for a patient a few
days after the end of the observation window).
eICU consists of medical records of 200,859 patients col-
lected from 208 critical care units in the United States be-
tween 2014 and 2015. We utilize the 50 most frequent lab-
oratory parameters as inputs. We conduct in-hospital mor-
tality risk prediction with different lengths of observation
window (increase from the ﬁrst day to the ﬁrst 6 days after
admission). We utilize all the adult patients with at least 2
visits within the observation window.
For both datasets, 70% of patients are randomly chosen as
the training set and the rest patients are used as the test set.
The experimental results are evaluated in terms of the area
under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC).
Comparing Methods
• Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forests (RF):
As baselines, LR (Hosmer Jr, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant
2013) and RF (Breiman 2001) are used to model means of
IMTS data since they are unable to model variable length
sequences.
• Independent Recurrent Neural Network (IndRNN):
Different from standard RNNs, neurons in IndRNN are
934

mented data are easier to capture. In addition, T-GRU+u and
T-GRU-raw+s outperform T-GRU and T-GRU-raw respec-
tively, which demonstrate the effeteness of each attention
mechanism. Furthermore, DATA-GRU consistently outper-
forms T-GRU+u and T-GRU-raw+s, which proves that the
proposed dual-attention can effectively capture information
from different views and improve ﬁnal results.
Case Study
To demonstrate the beneﬁt of applying DATA-GRU to real-
world risk prediction tasks, we analyze attention weights
learned by unreliability-aware and symptom-aware compo-
nents of DATA-GRU. Fig. 3 shows a case study for predict-
ing the in-hospital clinical outcome of a pneumonia patient
in MIMIC-III based on the EHR data within 5 days after ad-
mission. The patient information is provided in Table 3. In
Fig. 3, X-axis denotes time steps and Y-axis represents the
learned attention score. Fig. 3(a1) shows the attention weight
matrix learned by the unreliability-aware attention mecha-
nism, which demonstrates that different attention scores are
assigned to different elements in different time series. The
average attention score of different variables at each visit
is given in Fig. 3(a2), which shows that the unreliability-
aware mechanism assigns larger weights on the ﬁrst sev-
eral records. This is because many physiological variables
of the patient are actually examined in these visits. Further-
more, the unreliability-aware attention mechanism can ef-
fectively identify important variables. Fig. 4 shows atten-
tion weights contributed by all the 50 input variables. We
can see that attention scores assigned to these variables are
different. The item IDs of the 5 variables with the largest
weights for the pneumonia patient are 87 (Braden Score),
787 (Carbon Dioxide), 742 (calprevﬂg), 646 (SpO2), and
51277 (RDW), most of which have been proved to be closely
related to pneumonia (Sin, Man, and Marrie 2005). This
proves that the unreliability-aware attention can effectively
identify important variables and assign larger weights to re-
liable records to help them play important roles.
Fig. 3(b1) shows the attention matrix learned by the
symptom-aware attention mechanism, which can be seen is
different from Fig. 3(a1). This is because the unreliability-

aware attention considers the quality of data, while the
symptom-aware attention focuses on learning medical
knowledge from original clinical records. The average at-
tention score contributed by each visit is provided in Fig.
3(b2), which clearly shows that the symptom-aware atten-
tion focuses on visits in the middle. This is probably be-
cause the time intervals in the middle are small, due to which
the symptoms of the patient change frequently within a cer-
tain period. All these results prove that the proposed dual-
attention mechanism can analyze EHR data from different
views and capture different aspects of information, thus ef-
fectively improving risk prediction results.
Conclusion
This paper proposes a novel DATA-GRU to predict the mor-
tality risk of patients by using IMTS data. A time-aware
mechanism is introduced to directly handle the irregular
time intervals and preserve the contained useful information.
Furthermore, a novel dual-attention mechanism is designed
to tackle missing values in IMTS from both the data-quality
view and the medical-knowledge view. Extensive experi-
mental results and case study demonstrate that DATA-GRU
outperforms existing methods signiﬁcantly and provides in-

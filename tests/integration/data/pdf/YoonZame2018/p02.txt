within each data stream – in the intra-stream directions. An
M-RNN also operates across different data streams – in the
inter-stream directions. Unlike a Bi-RNN, the timing of inputs
into the hidden layers of our M-RNN is lagged in the forward
direction and advanced in the backward direction. As illustrated
in Fig. 2, our M-RNN architecture exploits the 3-dimensional
nature of the dataset.
An important aspect of medical data is that there is often
enormous uncertainty in the measured data. As is well-known,
although single imputation (SI) methods may yield the most
plausible/most likely estimate for each missing data point [13],
they do not capture the uncertainty in the imputed data [3].
Multiple imputation (MI) methods capture this uncertainty by
sampling imputed values several times in order to form multi-
ple complete imputed datasets, analyzing each imputed dataset
separately and combining the results via Rubin’s rule [3], [14],
[15]. Capturing the uncertainty in the dataset is especially im-
portant in the medical setting, in which diagnostic, prognostic
and treatment decisions must be made on the basis of the im-
puted values [16], [17]. In our setting, we use dropout [18] to
produce multiple imputations; see Section IV-D.
To demonstrate the power of our method, we apply it to ﬁve
different public real-world medical datasets: the MIMIC-III [19]
dataset, the clinical deterioration dataset used in [20], the UNOS
dataset for heart transplantation, the UNOS dataset for lung
transplantation (both available at https://www.unos.org/data/),
and the UK Biobank dataset [21]. We show that our method
yields large and statistically signiﬁcant improvements in esti-
mation accuracy over previous methods, including interpolation
methods such as [1], [2], imputation methods such as [3]–[6],
RNN-based imputation methods such as [22]–[24] and matrix
completion methods such as [7]. For the MIMIC-III and clini-
cal deterioration datasets the patient measurements were made
frequently (hourly basis), and our method provides Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE) improvement of more than 50% over all
11 benchmarks. For the UNOS heart and lung transplantation
datasets and the Biobank dataset, the patient measurements were
made much less frequently (yearly basis), but our method still
provides RMSE improvement of more than 40% in most cases,
and signiﬁcant improvements in the other cases. We also show
that this improvement in estimation yields (smaller) improve-
ments in the predictions of outcomes (patients’ future states). A
number of experiments based on these same datasets show that
the extent to which our method improves on outcomes depends
on the method used for prediction, on the way in which our
model is optimized in training, on the amount of data available
(both in terms of the number of patients for whom we have data
and on the amount of data available for each patient), and on
the nature and extent of missing data. These results illustrate
the important point that, as mentioned earlier, there are many
reasons for imputing missing data [15], [25] – for the estima-
tion of parameters (e.g., means or regression coefﬁcients), for
determination of conﬁdence intervals and signiﬁcance, as well
as for prediction – and that no single method for imputing data
can be expected to be superior on all datasets or for all reasons.
As [26] has emphasized, an extremely desirable aspect of
any imputation method is that it be congenial; i.e., that it
should produce imputed values in a manner that preserves
the original relationships between features and labels. As we
demonstrate using the complete Biobank dataset, our method is
also more congenial than the best competing benchmarks; see
Section VI-G.

As we have noted, there are three standard and very widely-
used methods for dealing with missing data: interpolation, im-
putation and matrix completion. Interpolation methods [1], [2]

datasets – and is of enormous importance for many reasons, in-
cluding statistical analysis, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.
In this paper we have presented a new method, based on a novel
deep learning architecture, for reconstructing/estimating miss-
ing data that exploits both the correlation within data streams
and the correlation across data streams. We have demonstrated
on the basis of a variety of real-world medical datasets that our
method makes large and statistically signiﬁcant improvements
in comparison with state-of-the-art benchmarks.
APPENDIX A
PREDICTIONS WITH ALTERNATIVE PREDICTIVE MODELS
Table V compares the implied predictive performance of M-
RNN with the benchmarks when imputation is followed by
prediction using a particularly simple predictive model. We
now compare the implied predictive performance of M-RNN
with the benchmarks when imputation is followed by predic-
tion using other predictive models: in addition to the 1-layer
RNN model used already, we use Random Forest [35], Logis-
tic Regression and Xgboost [34]. (For implementations, we use
the randomForest package, the glm package and the xgboost
package, all in R.) We restrict our attention to the MIMIC-III
dataset and continue to use AUROC as the performance metric.
Table VIII shows the mean and performance gain (%) (in terms
of AUROC) of M-RNN in comparison with the benchmarks
with various predictive models.
As can be seen in Table VIII, the different predictive models
do not yield much different prediction accuracy, and no one
predictive model seems to consistently lead to more or less
accurate predictions. (Because the RNN imputation methods
[22]–[24] can only be combined with an RNN predictive model,
there are no RF, LR, XG results for these methods.) Note that
prediction accuracy is not perfectly correlated with imputation
accuracy, but the differences are not statistically signiﬁcant. As
before, M-RNN leads to the most accurate predictions when
followed by each of the various predictive models; again, not all
the differences are statistically signiﬁcant.
APPENDIX B
EFFECTS OF DONOR FEATURES IN UNOS DATASETS
The UNOS organ transplant dataset records features of both
the recipient and the donor. In the main text we ignored donor
features; here we expand the analysis to include these features,
and compare the results obtained using only recipient features
with the results obtained using both recipient and donor features.

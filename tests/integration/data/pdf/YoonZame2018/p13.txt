TABLE XII
PERFORMANCE COMPARISON FOR MISSING DATA ESTIMATION FOR CATEGORICAL VARIABLES
presents the comparisons for prediction. As noted in the main
text, the differences are not large, presumably because the donor
information is completely static and the relevant aspects are cap-
tured implicitly in the recipient data. Note that the RNN-based
Interpolation-based methods do not utilize information across
features; hence, whether or not donor features are available, the
imputation performance of these methods is unchanged (See
Table IX).
As canbeseeninTables IXandX, theeffects of donor features
on imputation and prediction accuracy are not large. The RMSE
of M-RNN (MI) improves from from 0.0479 to 0.0451 (5.8%)
on the UNOS-Heart dataset and 0.0606 to 0.0579 (4.5%) on
the UNOS-Lung dataset. In terms of prediction, AUROC of
M-RNN (MI) improves from from 0.6855 to 0.7153 (9.5%) on
the UNOS-Heart dataset and from 0.6762 to 0.6883 (3.7%) on
UNOS-Lung dataset.
APPENDIX C
PREDICTION-ORIENTED M-RNN
Finally, we report the results of an experiment in which
we optimized M-RNN for prediction accuracy rather than im-
putation accuracy. To do this, we trained M-RNN to min-
imize the cross-entropy L = 1

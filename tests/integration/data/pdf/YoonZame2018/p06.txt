SUMMARY OF THE DATASETS (CONT: CONTINUOUS, CAT: CATEGORICAL, AVG: AVERAGE)
yearly follow-up information for the entire U.S. cohort of 69,205
patients who received heart transplants and 32,986 patients who
received lung transplants during the period 1985–2015. We view
patients in the dataset as described by a total of 34 clinical fea-
tures. (In fact, a total of 232 features are recorded in the UNOS
dataset, but many features are not recorded for most patients.
We therefore excluded the 198 features for which missing rates
were higher than 80%; this is in keeping with standard medical
statistical practice.) For each patient, a number of yearly follow-
ups are recorded; the smallest number of yearly follow-ups is
1, the largest is 26; the median number of follow-ups for heart
transplantation is 6 and the median number of follow-ups for
lung transplantation is 4. (In the main text, we focus entirely on
features of the patient, ignoring features of the donor. We do this
for two reasons: (i) the features of the patient change over time
but the features of the donor do not (because the donor is dead);
(ii) the relevant features of the donor appear to be largely cap-
tured in the time series measurements of the patient. However,
as we show in the Appendix, taking features of the donor into
account seems to make little difference for either imputation or
prediction.) For the purpose of prediction, we take the goal in
each case as predicting at each follow up time st whether the
patient will be dead one year later. Hence we assign the label
yt = 1 if the patient actually died within the following year and
yt = 0 otherwise.
D. Biobank
We used the UK Biobank dataset gathered from 21 assessment
centers across England, Wales, and Scotland using standardized
procedures from 2007 to 2014. (The UK Biobank protocol is
available online.) UK Biobank recorded various patient informa-
tion including baseline measurements, physical measurements,
and evaluations of biological samples. For this paper, we ex-
cluded all the variables that were missing for more than 80% of
the participants and all the static measurements and only used
the 113 longitudinal measurements. Of the 4,096 total patients,
we used only the data for the 3,902 patients who missed no
admissions to assessment centers (and hence were assessed the
maximum number of times, which was three) and for whom
there are no missing measurements of these 113 variables; thus
we have a complete dataset. A complete dataset is required for
the congeniality experiments described in Section VI-G, and
we can extract a complete dataset from the UK Biobank dataset.
In the other datasets we consider, there is no single patient for
whom the information is complete, and so a complete dataset
cannot be extracted and these datasets cannot be used for con-
geniality experiments. For the purpose of prediction we take the
goal to be the correct prediction of diabetes, so we assign the
label yt = 1 if diabetes is diagnosed at t and yt = 0 otherwise.
VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. Imputation Accuracy on the Given Datasets
We begin by comparing the performance of our method (using
both multiple imputations and single imputation) on the given
datasets against 11 benchmarks with respect to the accuracy
of imputing missing values. The benchmarks against which we
compare are: the algorithms proposed in [22]–[24]; Spline and
Cubic Interpolation [1]; MICE [5]; MissForest [6]; EM [4]; the
matrix completion algorithm of [7]; the Auto-Encoder algorithm
proposed in [32]; and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method [33]. (The details of the implementations for the various
benchmarks are presented in the Appendix.) As is common, we
use root mean squared error (RMSE) as the measure of per-
formance. In each experiment, we use 5-fold cross-validation.
Table II shows the mean RSME for our method and bench-
marks, and the percentage improvement of RMSE for M-RNN
(MI) over the benchmarks. (Note that we are unable to provide
results for the EM algorithm on the UNOS-Heart and UNOS-
Lung datasets because – at least for the implementation we use
– the EM algorithm requires at least one patient for whom data
is complete, and the UNOS-Heart and UNOS-Lung datasets do
not contain any such patient.)
As can be seen in Table II, M-RNN achieves better perfor-
mance (smaller RMSE) than all of the benchmarks on all of
the datasets (for all comparisons are possible). With a single
exception (the comparison with MissForest on the UNOS-Lung
dataset) the performance improvements are statistically signif-
icant at the 95% level (i.e., p < 0.05), and many of the im-
provements are very large. For instance, for the Deterioration
dataset, M-RNN using multiple imputations achieves RMSE
of 0.0105 (95% CI: 0.0071–0.0138), while the best bench-
mark (Spline interpolation) achieves RMSE of 0.0215 (95%
CI: 0.0178–0.0255); this represents an improvement of 51.2%.
The performance comparisons across datasets are reveal-
ing, if not necessarily surprising. The interpolation benchmarks

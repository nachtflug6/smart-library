PERFORMANCE COMPARISON FOR MISSING DATA ESTIMATION
(such as Spline, Cubic and RNN-based methods) work best
on datasets, such as MIMIC-III and Deterioration, for which
measurements were more frequent (and more highly correlated
within each stream (see Table I)); the imputation benchmarks
work best on datasets, such as UNOS-Heart and UNOS-Lung,
for which measurements were less frequent but for which there
were many streams of data (many dimensions). The improve-
ment of our method over all benchmarks is larger for the
MIMIC-III and Deterioration datasets because those datasets
have many streams of frequently sampled data, so that our
method gains a great deal from exploiting both the correla-
tions within each data stream and the correlations across data
streams. Conversely, the improvement of our method is smaller
for the UNOS-Heart and UNOS-Lung datasets, because streams
in those datasets are infrequently sampled to that there is less
to be gained by exploiting the correlations within data streams.
(The performances of the benchmarks for the Biobank dataset
are mixed, and don’t quite ﬁt this same pattern, perhaps be-
cause Biobank is a small dataset (less than 4,000 patients with
complete temporal data streams)).
1) Multiple Imputations vs. Single Imputation: As we
have noted, the purpose of conducting multiple imputations is
to reduce uncertainty/shrink conﬁdence intervals (rather than to
improve average performance). As is illustrated in the box-plot
in Fig. 3(a) which shows the comparison of M-RNN with multi-
ple imputations and M-RNN with a single imputation against the
best benchmark (Cubic interpolation) on the MIMIC-III dataset,
our multiple imputations do achieve this purpose. (For discus-
sion of Fig. 3(b), which illustrates the corresponding reduction
in uncertainty for prediction, see below).
2) Combining Models of Interpolation and Imputation:
As we have already discussed, standard interpolation algorithms
cannot capture the patterns across streams and standard imputa-
tion algorithms cannot capture the patterns within the streams.
However, it is possible to combine a standard interpolation al-
gorithm and standard imputation algorithm in an attempt to
capture both patterns, and it might be thought that such a com-
bination would be a fairer benchmark against which to compare

our method. To put this idea to the test, we create a family of
“joint algorithms” by ﬁrst using an interpolation algorithm to
interpolate the missing values, and then using the interpolated
values as the initial points of an imputation algorithm to pro-
vide ﬁnal imputed values. For this exercise, we use two standard
interpolation methods (Cubic and Spline), and two standard im-
putation methods (MICE and MissForest) so that we have 4
interpolation-imputation combination models: Cubic + MICE,
Cubic + MissForest, Spline + MICE, and Spline + MissForest.
As Table III shows, however, the performances of these
interpolation-imputation combination models are very similar
to those of the performance of the simple imputation model that
is used. Indeed, the largest RMSE performance improvement is
only 0.0018. The reason for this is that imputation methods use
algorithms that operate iteratively until they converge, so that
their performance is rather robust to the initialization. Hence,
although the interpolation part of the joint models captures some
of the inter-stream information, the iterative imputation part ig-
nores most of what is captured.

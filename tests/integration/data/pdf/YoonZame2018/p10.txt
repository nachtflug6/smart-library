experiments with increased rates of missing data in order to
understand the implications for the accuracy of prediction. To
explore the predictive performance for a wide range of missing
rates (from 0% to 90%), we begin with the Biobank dataset,
which is a complete dataset. We randomly remove 10% to 90%
of the measurements (with increments of 10%) to create multi-
ple datasets with different missing rates. (In each case we use
80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.) As before, we
use M-RNN and various benchmarks for imputing missing data
and a 1-layer RNN as the predictive model. (In this setting we
are predicting a clinical diagnosis of diabetes.) In each setting,
we conducted 10 trials, and report the performance in terms of
AUROC.
Fig. 5(a) illustrates the impact (in terms of AUROC) of
increasing amounts of missing data for M-RNN and various
benchmarks. As Fig. 5(a) shows, for M-RNN and all bench-
marks, the prediction performance decreases as the amount of
missing data increases. However, as Fig. 5(b) shows, M-RNN
continues to outperform the benchmarks; indeed, the perfor-
mance gap between M-RNN and the benchmarks widens when

more data is missing. That is: the importance of accurate impu-
tation is greater when more data is missing.
F. The Importance of Speciﬁc Features
To this point, we have treated all missing data as equally
important and given the same weight to all errors. However,
this is not always the right thing to do. In particular, it is clear
that not all missing data is equally important for prediction.
To understand the importance of missing data for purposes of
prediction we conduct two experiments in parallel. For the ﬁrst
experiment (which we call Setting A: Purely Random Removal),
we construct 5 sub-samples of the MIMIC-III dataset by ran-
domly removing an additional 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% of
the measurements for randomly chosen features. For the second
experiment (which we call Setting B: Correlated Random Re-
moval) we ﬁrst identify the four features that are most highly
correlated with the mortality label; those are anion gap, bicar-
bonate, systolic blood pressure, and pottasium. We then con-
struct 5 sub-samples of the MIMIC-III dataset by removing an
additional 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% of the measurements for
these speciﬁc features. In both cases we repeat the exercise 10
times and report average results. We then compare the predic-
tion performance of M-RNN (MI) with the best benchmarks;
the results are shown visually in Fig. 6.

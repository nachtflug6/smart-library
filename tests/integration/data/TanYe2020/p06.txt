nected across different layers (Li et al. 2018).
• T-LSTM and T-LSTM-ND: T-LSTM (Baytas et al.
2017) described in the introduction section. Since T-
LSTM is designed for longitudinal records, it decomposes
data into long and short memory, which may not be suit-
able for ICU data. So we also compare with T-LSTM
without such decomposition structure (T-LSTM-ND).
• GRU-D: GRU-D (Che et al. 2018) described in the intro-
duction section.
• InterpNet: InterpNet (Shukla and Marlin 2019) de-
scribed in the introduction section.
• DATA-GRU variants: Besides above methods, we con-
sider six variants of DATA-GRU to verify the effective-
ness of each component: (a) standard GRU for original
records (GRU-raw) and augmented records (GRU); (b) T-
GRU and T-GRU-raw are GRU and GRU-raw with the
time-aware mechanism; (c) T-GRU-raw+s is T-GRU-raw
with symptom-aware attention; (d) T-GRU+u is T-GRU
with unreliability-aware attention.
Results and Discussion
The AUC scores of DATA-GRU and comparing methods for
MIMIC-III and eICU are provided in Table 1 and Table 2. It
can be seen that the AUC scores of DATA-GRU are continu-
ally larger than that of other methods for both datasets. E.g.,
for the in-hospital mortality prediction of MIMIC-III, the
AUC score of DATA-GRU is 0.919, which is signiﬁcantly
larger than 0.903 achieved by InterpNet (Shukla and Marlin
2019). These results demonstrate that DATA-GRU achieves
the best performance regardless of the prediction levels and
the lengths of observation window. There are several pos-
sible reasons. Firstly, DATA-GRU introduces a time-aware
structure to directly handle irregular intervals without the
necessity of processing IMTS into equally-spaced, thus suc-
cessfully preserving the contained useful information on the
dynamics of patients’ health status. Secondly, DATA-GRU
designs novel dual-attention consisting of two novel atten-
tion mechanisms to handle missing values, thus capturing
useful information from different views. Furthermore, all the
parameters of DATA-GRU are optimized jointly, ensuring
different components collaborate well to achieve global op-
timal. Besides, several other observations are drawn:
Firstly, DATA-GRU outperforms InterpNet (Shukla and
Marlin 2019) by a large margin. InterpNet is the repre-
sentative of processing IMTS into equally spaced, which
may damage the medical considerations behind the sampling
characteristic of EHR data and do not perform well when the
number of original records is small, e.g., in-hospital mor-
tality prediction for eICU with one day’s observation data.
In comparison, DATA-GRU avoids processing IMTS into
equally spaced by introducing a time-aware structure to han-
dle irregular intervals, achieving better results.
Secondly, DATA-GRU outperforms GRU-D (Che et al.
2018) and T-LSTM (including T-LSTM-ND, Baytas et al.
2017) signiﬁcantly. This is because GRU-D and T-LSTM are
unable to identify the differences in the reliability of differ-
ent data points and thus cannot adjust the assigned weights.
As a result, imputed values could play equal contributions
with actual records even when they deviate from reality, thus
severely affecting ﬁnal prediction results.
Thirdly, variations of RNN with the time-aware mecha-
nism generally outperform variations without such mech-
anism. E.g., for MIMIC-III, at the 1-day prediction level,
AUC scores of T-GRU and T-LSTM-ND are 0.902 and
0.899, which are larger than 0.894 and 0.892 achieved by
IndRNN and GRU. These results demonstrate that the intro-
duction of the time-aware mechanism promotes the capac-
ity of handling irregularly spaced data. Experimental results
show that T-LSTM does not perform well for these tasks,
which is probably because its decomposition structure dam-
ages the short-term information in ICU data.
Finally, modeling augmented records usually results in
better results than directly modeling original records, e.g.,
for all the prediction tasks in eICU, T-GRU outperforms
T-GRU-raw and T-GRU+u surpasses T-GRU-raw+s. This
is probably because original EHR data is highly complex
with both missing values and varying intervals, due to
which the contained medical knowledge is difﬁcult to ex-
tract. Conversely, temporal dependencies contained in aug-

the obtained readout models that are further efﬁciently clas-
siﬁed. Extended from this, MBMs have proven effective in
various domains, such as the fault diagnosis of the Barcelona
water network (Quevedo et al. 2014) and diverse sequence
classiﬁcation tasks (Gong et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2020; Chen,
Zhou, and Chen 2024). Besides, MBMs have also been em-
ployed for underground diagnosis by considering two direc-
tions’ dynamic characteristics (Chen et al. 2023; Liu, Zhou,
and Chen 2024). While existing studies show MBMs’ ef-
fectiveness in sequential data analysis, current MBMs use
ESN-based methods for data ﬁtting. ESN, with uniform state
updates across time steps, is not suited for irregular sequence
ﬁtting and dynamic capturing.
Methodology
This section outlines the irregular sequence classiﬁcation in
the Ct-Echo model space, unfolding in three parts:
• Capture Dynamic Characteristics via Ct-Echo: This
initiates our method by ﬁtting sequences through Ct-
Echo, representing each sequence by a ﬁtted model.
• Distance Metric between Ct-Echo Models: The next
part introduces a reasonable distance metric to measure
differences between Ct-Echo models.
• Anomaly Detection in the Ct-Echo Model Space: Rep-
resenting the sequences with ﬁtted models, supported
with the distance metric between models, anomaly de-
tection is implemented in the Ct-Echo model space.
Capture Dynamic Characteristics via Ct-Echo
Similar to ESN, Ct-Echo is composed of: the Input layer,
the Hidden layer that consists of a reservoir subjected
to continuous-time transitions facilitated by ODE, and the
Output layer. In this structure, 1) an irregular sequence is
sent into the input layer, 2) and then iterated in the hidden
layer considering both the history and current information to
generate continuous-time hidden states, 3) resulting in out-
put through the output layer.
Among them, the reservoir in the hidden layer is a re-
current network with parameters randomly generated and
ﬁxed under the echo state property, ensuring that history
information inﬂuences the current state and gradually di-
minishes over time. Besides, the use of ODE in the hidden
layer allows for the integration of hidden states at any time
point. Therefore, Ct-Echo gives a continuous-time transition
of hidden states under irregular time intervals, beneﬁcial to
capturing the dynamic characteristics of irregular sequences.
The Ct-Echo is adapted into two variants:
• Ct-Echo-Decay: The linear ODE, independent of the in-
put sequence, is used to construct the continuous-time
transition of hidden states.
• Ct-Echo-Leaky: The leaky integrator, considering the
input sequence, is integrated into the reservoir to process
continuous-time hidden states.
Ct-Echo-Decay
In the ﬁrst variant of Ct-Echo, the ODE
processes hidden states independently of the input3 x. As
3An irregular sequence is x = [x(t1), x(t2), . . . , x(tE)], t is
the sampling time, and E is the number of sampling time points.

(b) Flow of Ct-Echo-Decay in hidden layer
Figure 3: Illustration of Ct-Echo-Decay. (a) is the structure,
consisting of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output
layer. It uses ODEs in the hidden layer to help the reservoir
establish continuous-time hidden states. (b) is the processing
ﬂow in the hidden layer. The blue line is the continuous-time
transition achieved by ODE, and the red line is the hidden
state computation in the reservoir.
shown in Figure 3(a), the input x is sent into the hidden layer
sequentially through the input layer. Ct-Echo operates in the
hidden layer according to the following iterative formula:
hm(tn) = ODESolver(fθ(h), h(tn−1), (tn−1, tn)),
h(tn) = tanh(Whh · hm(tn) + Whx · x(tn)),
(1)
where hm(tn) represents the intermediate hidden state at
time tn, ODESolver is a solver for ODE, fθ denotes the
ODE governed by parameters θ, h(tn−1) is the previous hid-
den state (initial value of ODESolver), (tn−1, tn) is the
time interval, h(tn) is the updated hidden state, Whh and
Whx are the weights for hidden layer (reservoir) and input
layer, respectively, and x(tn) is the data point at time tn.
During the iteration (Figure 3(b)) in Ct-Echo-Decay, the
previous hidden state is continuously transitioned to the cur-
rent step as an intermediate hidden state using the ODE. This
intermediate hidden state, combined with the current input
value, then determines the current hidden state. As iterations
progress, the above process persists, linking each data point
to prior ones, thus effectively preserving the dynamic char-
acteristics within the sequence.
In this paper, we choose the linear ODE function as fθ
within the ODESolver in Formula (1), given as
dh
dt = fθ(h) = τ · h,
(2)
where τ < 0 is the decay rate. This ODE is solvable analyt-
ically, and its solution describes an exponential decay pro-

results of the BDLSTM-I + BDLSTM obviously outperforms those of other compared models.
When the missing rate is relatively large (40% and 80%), the one-layer models, including the GRU-D, LSTM-I, and BDLSTM-I,
cannot compete with the two-layer models. In all cases, the two-layer models with a BDLSTM second layer perform better than those
with an LSTM second layer. The BDLSTM-I + BDLSTM model achieves the smallest prediction errors.
Overall, the prediction results in the non-random scenario are close to or slightly better than those in the random scenario. The
prediction results on the LOOP-SEA dataset have larger deviations than those on the PMES-BAY dataset. The models containing a
BDLSTM-I layer slightly outperform the models with an LSTM-I layer. The experimental results also indicate that the BDLSTM is
appropriate to be the last layer of a model, compared with LSTM. Hence, the BDLSTM-I + BDLSTM model outperforms other models,
which is particularly obvious on the PEMS-BAY dataset.
4.6.2. Comparison with data imputation methods
As mentioned before, values generated by the proposed imputation unit (x t
_ ) may not be the “actual“ missing values. However,
comparing data imputation performance of the proposed model with other data imputation models can still be informative. In this
section, we compare the imputation performance of BDLSTM-I + BDLSTM and the BGCP model. The experimental results tested on
both LOOP-SEA and PEMS-BAY datasets are presented in Table 8. The proposed method outperforms the BGCP when the missing rate
is relatively small. The imputation performance of the BDLSTM-based model decreases along with the increase of the missing rate.
However, the imputation errors of the BGCP model nearly keep the same when the missing rate varies. This is reasonable because the
data imputation mechanism of BGCP, which is a tensor decomposition-based model, greatly differs from that of deep learning models.
The data imputation mechanism of a trained LSTM-I only uses a short-term sequence data as input data. However, tensor decom-
position-based methods use the whole datasets to impute missing data. Besides, tensor decomposition-based models use different
types of optimization methods and have more optimization iterations. In summary, although the proposed method is not designed for
solving data imputation tasks and uses much fewer data, it can achieve similar imputation performance as the BGCP model. This
experimental results imply that the proposed imputation unit in LSTM-I/BDLSTM-I can indirectly contribute to the traffic prediction
task.
4.7. Model interpretation and visualization
In this section, we take several specific regions as examples to conduct experimental validation and visualization. Fig. 5a and b
show the ground truth and predicted traffic states of two sensing locations selected from the LOOP-SEA dataset. Fig. 5c and d show
the results of two sensing locations selected from the PEMS-BAY dataset. The traffic states in the LOOP-SEA dataset have more
variations and the traffic states in the PEMS-BAY dataset varies smoothly. As shown by those figures, different traffic patterns on
weekdays and weekends and the various traffic states during the peak hours can be accurately predicted.
5. Conclusion
In this study, we attempt to reformulate the way to incorporate LSTM into traffic prediction models. A stacked bidirectional and
unidirectional LSTM network architecture is proposed for network-wide traffic state prediction. Experimental results show that the
stacked bidirectional LSTM models achieve the superior prediction performance. In addition, the evaluation of the prediction cap-
ability of multiple stacked LSTM- or BDLSTM-based models has great potential to facilitate the design of neural network models for
traffic prediction problems.
We also proposed an imputation unit in the LSTM model, which is designed to handle missing values. The LSTM- or BDLSTM-
based models with the imputation unit can infer and fill the missing values in the spatial–temporal input data and in return to help
improve prediction accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed models with the imputation unit can outperform the
state-of-the-art RNN based models and compete with the tensor decomposition based models. Further, the trade-off between model
capacity and complexity and the influential factors of the proposed model are evaluated and discussed. In addition, two real-world
traffic state data is tested in this study and the LOOP-SEA dataset is published on public accessible repositories to facilitate further
research in this field.
In the future, we will carry out more in-depth studies using different datasets. Further improvements and extensions may focus on

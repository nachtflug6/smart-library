4.5. Influential Factors of the RNN-based Model
Two factors that influene the prediction perforamnce, including the size of the model weights and the amount of time lags of the
input sequences, are measured in this section.
4.5.1. Influence of the size of model weights
Since the spatial dimension of prediction output should be same as the spatial dimension of the input sequnces (D), the weight
matrices in one-layer LSTM or BDLSTM, i.e. the W and U in Eqs. (3)–(6), should be with the dimension of

D. For a multi-layer
LSTM or BDLSTM, the dimension of the weight matrices in each layer can be customized, except for the first dimension of the weight
matrices in the first layer and the second dimension of the weight matrics in the last layer that should be D. Hence, in this section, we
change the dimensions of the customizable weight matrices in a two-layer BDLSTM to mesure the influence of the size of model
weights on the prediction performance. The customized dimensions include

generated by the two-layer BDLSTM tested on both LOOP-SEA and PEMS-BAY datasets are shown in Table 3. The results indicate that
the more parameters the model contains, the more accurate the predicttion results are. When the customized dimension reduces to

, the prediction performance on both datasets obviously decreases. When the customized dimension increase to
D
4 , the model
achieves best prediciton accuracy on the PEMS-BAY dataset. However, the prediction performance cannot improve much on the
LOOP-SEA dataset. This phenomenon shows that for a specific type of models, increasing the amount of parameters can improve the
model’s prediction capability to some extent. However, the prediction accuracy will not keep improving along with the increase of
the amount of model parameters.
4.5.2. Influence of the length of the input sequences
The length of the input sequences has an influence on the short-term traffic forecasting performance. Fig. 4b shows the boxplot of
the MAE of a BDLSTM + LSTM model versus the length of the input sequence tested on the LOOP-SEA dataset. When the length
equals 8, 10, and 12, the MAEs of the predictions are very close and the deviations of these MAEs are relatively small. When the
number of time lags is set as 6, the MAE is much higher, and the deviation is much larger than that of other cases. That means, given
the 5-min time interval and the studied traffic network, 6 steps of traffic sequnce data are not long enough for modeling and
predicting network-wide traffic states accurately. In summary, the number of time lags tends to influence the predictive performance,
especially when the input sequences is relatively short.
4.6. Dealing with missing values
In this section, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed imputation unit in the LSTM-based strucutres, we compared the
prediction performance of GRU-D Che et al. (2018), LSTM-I, and BDLSTM-I. Since the previous sections show that two-layer LSTM- or
BDLSTM-based two-layer models have better prediction performance, the LSTM-I and BDLSTM-I stacked with LSTM or BDLSTM is
also compared. Besides, although the proposed imputation unit in LSTM-I is designed for doing data imputation tasks, we still attempt
to compare the data imputation performance of the proposed models with a state-of-the-art data imputation model, i.e. the Bayesian
Gaussian CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (BGCP) tensor decomposition model Chen et al. (2019b). The parameters of the BGCP is identical
to the parameter settings in Chen et al. (2019b).
4.6.1. Comparison with forecasting methods
In this section, the compared models are tested on the LOOP-SEA and PEMS-BAY datasets with different missing scenarios,
including random and non-random scenarios, and different missing rates ranging from 10% to 80%. The experimental results tested
on the two datasets with random missing value are shown in Table 4 and 5, and the results tested on datasets with the non-random
missing value scenario are shown in Table 6 and 7, respectively.
When the missing rate is relatively small (10% and 20%), the experimental results indicate that the GRU-D model cannot out-
perform other compared models in the random missing scenarios. The LSTM-I also cannot deal with the missing values very well,
especially in the non-random missing scenarios. However, the bidirectional and stacked LSTM-models achieve better prediction
accuracy on the LOOP-SEA datasets. Further, experimental results on the PEMS-BAY datasets show that the models with a BDLSTM as
the last layer perform better no matter in the random or non-random missing scenario. Among the two-layer models, the prediction

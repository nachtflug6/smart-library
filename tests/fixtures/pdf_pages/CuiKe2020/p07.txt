spatial–temporal information of the traffic network to the BDLSTMs, both the spatial correlation of the speeds in different locations
and the temporal dependencies among the traffic state sequences can be captured during the feature learning process. In this regard, a
BDLSTM layer is suitable for being the first feature learning layer of a stacked architecture for network-wide traffic prediction.
Meanwhile, if the input data contains missing values, a BDLSTM-I layer with the ability to deal with missing values will be used
instead.
For the proposed stacked architecture, the stacking/following layers could be LSTM instead of BDLSTM. Since BDLSTM contains
more learnable parameters, the architecture of stacked BDLSTMs has the potential to perform better. Hence, the proposed SBU-LSTM
contains a BDLSTM-I layer as the first feature-learning layer with the capability of imputing missing values. For the sake of making
full use of the input data and learning complex and comprehensive features, in a SBU-LSTM architecture, the BDLSTM-I layer can be
optionally stacked with one or more LSTM/BDLSTM layers.
The SBU-LSTM takes the sequence data as the input. The output
+

_
1 is generated by the last layer of SBU-LSTM. If the dataset
contains missing values, the first layer of SBU-LSTM should be a BDLSTM-I. Then, the SBU-LSTM can bring the imputation errors from
the BDLSTM-I layer into its loss function as a regularization term:

4. Experiments
4.1. Dataset
In this study, two real-world network-scale traffic state datasets are used for testing models.
4.1.1. LOOP-SEA Dataset
The dataset named as LOOP-SEA is collected by inductive loop detectors deployed on 4 connected freeways (I-5, I-405, I-90, and
SR-520) in the greater Seattle area, as shown in Fig. 3a. This dataset contains traffic speed data of 323 sensor stations (

and

105120 time steps in total. For this traffic forecasting problem, if we suppose the length of
the input sequence is 10 (T = 10), the dataset contains (105120
10) samples in total. The dataset is published on GitHub (https://
github.com/zhiyongc/Seattle-Loop-Data) Cui et al. (2016) and Zenodo Wang et al. (2019).
4.1.2. PEMS-BAY Dataset
This dataset named as PEMS-BAY is collected by California Transportation Agencies (CalTrans) Performance Measurement System
(PeMS). This dataset contains the speed information of 325 sensor stations in the Bay Area, as shown in Fig. 3b. The dataset covers six
months ranging from Jan 1st, 2017 to Jun 30th, 2017. The interval of time steps is 5-min. The total number of observed traffic data
points is 16,941,600. The dataset is published by Li et al. (2018) on the Github (https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN).

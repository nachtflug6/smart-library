Table 3: Dataset statistics. The ‘#-timestamps’ refers to the number of all sampling timestamps measured in this
dataset. The ‘#-classes’ means the number of categories in dataset labels. The ’Static info’ indicates if sample’s
static attributes (e.g., height and weight) are available. The ‘missing ratio’ denotes the ratio between the number
of missing observations and the number of all possible observations if the dataset is fully-observed.

Our results on Setting 1 are consistent with those on Settings 2-4. Results on harder Settings 2-4 show
that Raindrop can perform comparably better than baselines. Results across these diverse settings
increase our conﬁdence that Raindrop is quite ﬂexible and widely applicable.

FURTHER DETAILS ON DATASETS
P19: PhysioNet Sepsis Early Prediction Challenge 2019. P19 dataset (Reyna et al., 2020) contains
38,803 patients and each patient is monitored by 34 irregularly sampled sensors including 8 vital
signs and 26 laboratory values. The original dataset has 40,336 patients, we remove the samples with
too short or too long time series, remaining 38,803 patients (the longest time series of the patient
has more than one and less than 60 observations). Each patient is associated with a static vector
indicating attributes: age, gender, time between hospital admission and ICU admission, ICU type,
and ICU length of stay (days). Each patient has a binary label representing occurrence of sepsis
within the next 6 hours. The dataset is highly imbalanced with only ∼4% positive samples.
P12: PhysioNet Mortality Prediction Challenge 2012. P12 dataset (Goldberger et al., 2000)
includes 11,988 patients (samples), after removing 12 inappropriate samples following (Horn et al.,
2020). Each patient contains multivariate time series with 36 sensors (excluding weight), which are
collected in the ﬁrst 48-hour stay in ICU. Each sample has a static vector with 9 elements including
age, gender, etc. Each patient is associated with a binary label indicating length of stay in ICU, where
negative label means hospitalization is not longer than 3 days and positive label marks hospitalization
is longer than 3 days. P12 is imbalanced with ∼93% positive samples.
PAM: PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring. PAM dataset (Reiss & Stricker, 2012) measures
daily living activities of 9 subjects with 3 inertial measurement units. We modify it to suit our
scenario of irregular time series classiﬁcation. We excluded the ninth subject due to short length
of sensor readouts. We segment the continuous signals into samples with the time window of 600
and the overlapping rate of 50%. PAM originally has 18 activities of daily life. We exclude the
ones associated with less than 500 samples, remaining 8 activities. After modiﬁcation, PAM dataset
contains 5,333 segments (samples) of sensory signals. Each sample is measured by 17 sensors
and contains 600 continuous observations with the sampling frequency 100 Hz. To make time
series irregular, we randomly remove 60% of observations. To keep fair comparison, the removed
observations are randomly selected but kept the same for all experimental settings and approaches.
PAM is labelled by 8 classes where each class represents an activity of daily living. PAM does not
include static attributes and the samples are approximately balanced across all 8 categories.
To feed given data into neural networks, we set the input as zero if no value was measured. In highly
imbalanced datasets (P19 and P12) we perform batch minority class upsampling, which means that
every processed batch has the same number of positive and negative class samples. The dataset
statistics including sparse ratio are provided in Table 3.

FURTHER DETAILS ON MODEL HYPERPARAMETERS
Baseline hyperparameters. The implementation of baselines follows the corresponding papers
including SeFT (Horn et al., 2020), GRU-D (Che et al., 2018), and mTAND (Shukla & Marlin,
2021). We follow the settings of Transformer baseline in (Horn et al., 2020) while implementing
Transformer in our work. For average imputation in Trans-mean, we replace the missing values by
the global mean value of observations in the sensor (Shukla & Marlin, 2020). We use batch size of

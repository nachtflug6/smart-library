Figure 5: Differential structure of dependency graphs between positive and negative samples. The edges are
directed. We select the top 50 edges with largest difference (in absolute value) between two patterns. The edges
are colored by the divergences. The darker color denotes the connection is more crucial to classiﬁcation task.
Node 0 is not included in this ﬁgure as it is not connected with any sensor. We can infer that the heart rate is
stable whether the patient will get sepsis or not. Moreover, we can see the edge from node 3 (systolic BP) to
node 13 (Oxygen saturation from arterial blood) and the connection from node 6 (Respiration rate) to node 25
(Potassium) are informative for distinguishing sample classes.
https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/. We list the sensor names here: 0: HR; 1: O2Sat;
2: Temp; 3: SBP; 4: MAP; 5: DBP; 6: Resp; 7: EtCO2; 8: BaseExcess; 9: HCO3; 10: FiO2; 11:
pH; 12: PaCO2; 13: SaO2; 14: AST; 15: BUN; 16: Alkalinephos; 17: Calcium; 18: Chloride; 19:
Creatinine; 20: Bilirubin_direct; 21: Glucose; 22: Lactate; 23: Magnesium; 24: Phosphate; 25:
Potassium; 26: Bilirubin_total; 27: TroponinI; 28: Hct; 29: Hgb; 30: PTT; 31: WBC; 32: Fibrinogen;
33: Platelets.
We also visualize the differential inter-sensor connections between the learned dependency graphs
from patients who are likely to have sepsis and the graphs from patients who are unlikely to suffer
from sepsis. Based on the aggregated graph structures of positive and negative samples, we calculate
the divergence between two groups of patients and report the results in Figure 5. In detail, we sort
edges by the absolute difference of edge weights across negative and positive samples. On top of
the visualization of the 50 most distinctive edges, we can have a series of concrete insights. For
example, the dependency between node 6 (Respiration rate) to node 25 (Potassium) is important to
the early prediction of sepsis. Note these data-driven observations could be biased and still need
conﬁrmation and future analysis from healthcare professionals. The edges in both Figure 4 and
Figure 5 are directed. The edge arrows might be difﬁcult to recognize due to the small ﬁgure size.
We will provide high-resolution ﬁgures to our public repository.
Furthermore, we statistically measure the similarities across samples within the same class and
dissimilarities across samples from different classes. Speciﬁcally, for every sample, we calculate:
1) the average Euclidean distance between its dependency graph and the dependency graphs of all
samples from the same class; 2) the average distance with all samples from the different classes. The
P19 dataset has 38,803 samples including 1,623 positive samples and 37,180 negative samples. For
a fair comparison, we randomly select 1,623 samples from the negative cohort, then mixed them
with an equal number of positive samples to measure the averaged Euclidean distances intra- and
inter-classes. We select the cohort for 5 independent times with replacement. We ﬁnd that the distance
((8.6 ± 1.7) × 10−5) among dependency graphs of positive samples is smaller than the distance
((12.9 ± 3.1) × 10−5) across samples. The results show that the learned dependency graphs are
similar within the same class and dissimilar across classes, which demonstrates RAINDROP can learn
label-sensitive dependency graphs.

and second highest performance over the MIMIC-III dataset and
PhysioNet 2012 challenge datasets, respectively. This ﬁnding
highlights the need for adjusting the time interval instead of
using this information directly. Notably, T-LSTM [8] showed
the highest RMSE and MAE in both PhysioNet 2012 and
MIMIC-III datasets, suggesting the necessity of missing pattern
information, as the T-LSTM only considers the time intervals,
unlike the other methods.
3) Phenotyping: The phenotyping result is available only for
the MIMIC-III dataset as the PhysioNet 2012 challenge dataset
does not provide phenotyping labels. The attention-based meth-
ods outperformed the recurrence-based and imputation-based
methods. In particular, our proposed method showed the best
performance with an mAUC of 0.8359 and AUPRC of 0.5631,
followed by the SAnD [14] model. Most recurrence-based
methods presented relatively better performance compared to
interpolation-based methods. GRU-D [7], which used both the
missing indicators and time interval similar to the proposed
method, demonstrated a competitive performance among the
recurrence-based methods, which implies the necessity of uti-
lizing the representations from the missing pattern. Furthermore,
T-LSTM [8] exhibited the lowest performance, because it only
considers the time intervals between the observations with a
simple decay function.
These experimental results validated the efﬁcacy of the pro-
posed method that learns the multi-view representations of
irregular time series data and their deep integration by the
self-attention mechanism and further builds the auxiliary miss-
ing data imputer, showing its superior performance in various
downstream tasks.
B. Ablation Study
According to Table III and Table IV, integrating the ob-
servation and sources of missingness yielded superior results
than those obtained using only the observation, and the highest

datasets in all downstream tasks corresponded to the integration
for triple views. This ﬁnding demonstrated the effectiveness of
incorporating the observation and sources of missingness. In the
double view cases, the scenario of (X + Δ) corresponded to a
slightly higher performance in terms of the mortality and LOS
prediction compared to that of the (X + M) case in both datasets
for all downstream tasks.
To further examine the observation and sources of missing-
ness, we conducted an additional ablation study to extract the
missingness. Table IX and Table X showed the performance
of the proposed model with Δ or M as query input. In both
datasets, the scenario of letting Δ as a query achieved superior

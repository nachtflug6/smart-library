approach with the case of using the imputed data by the BRITS
imputer [17], which is the SOTA imputation method, and the
auxiliary imputer.
1) In-Hospital Mortality Prediction: On both the datasets, our
model achieved the best classiﬁcation performance with AUC
of 0.8201 and 0.8534. Overall the recurrence-based methods
outperformed the interpolation methods. Among the recurrence-
basedmethods,ODE-LSTM[6]whichtakesirregularlysampled
time series as input and simultaneously handles time intervals
demonstrated a competitive performance. This ﬁnding suggests
theneedtodirectlymodel irregularlysampledtimeseries andthe
more sophisticated use of missing indicators and time interval,
as implemented in the proposed model.
2) LOS Prediction: The proposed model again demonstrated
the highest performance achieving the lowest RMSE and
MAE for both datasets. Most recurrence-based and attention-
based methods showed relatively better performance than the
imputation-based methods. ATTAIN [9] exhibited the highest
